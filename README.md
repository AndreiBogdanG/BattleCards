Just a simple cards game:

The deck is split equally between two players.

Each player draws the top card from their deck.
The player with the higher card wins both cards.

If the cards are equal, a battle starts.
Each player draws a number of cards equal to the value of the tied cards (or as many as they have if fewer).
The highest card among the drawn cards wins the battle, taking all drawn cards.

The game continues until one player has all the cards.
The player who runs out of cards loses the game.
